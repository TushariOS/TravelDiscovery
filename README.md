## SwiftUI
- SwiftUI is Apple's modern and declarative framework for building user interfaces across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
- It uses a simple and intuitive syntax for creating user interfaces, making it easier for developers to design and build apps.

## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
- MVVM is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and ViewModel.
- It promotes separation of concerns and testability in your code. The ViewModel handles the presentation logic, while the View is responsible for displaying data.

## Navigation
- Navigation refers to the user's ability to move between different screens or views in an application.
- In SwiftUI, you can implement navigation using NavigationView, NavigationLink, and NavigationButton.

## Network Calls
- Network calls involve the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses.
This includes handling common tasks like handling response codes, parsing JSON, and error handling.

## Displaying Images:
- In SwiftUI, you can display images using the Image view. You can load images from assets, URLs, or system symbols.
- You can customize the appearance of images, such as resizing, scaling, and rendering mode.

## Maps:
- Map integration involves displaying interactive maps within your app.
- In iOS, you can use the MapKit framework to incorporate maps and location-based services into your application.

## UIScrollView with UIImage:
- UIScrollView is a scrollable view that can host content larger than the screen size.
- You can use it to display large images and enable users to scroll and zoom in or out.
Custom UI Development:

## Custom UI development allows you to create unique and tailored user interfaces for your app.
- SwiftUI provides tools for creating custom views, combining components, and implementing unique designs.
